start in tutorial room with some moving defenseless enemies that you must destroy. Once you destroy those, you can go into the world. THe world is a randomly creating, endless world. THe enemies start out uniform and then as they level up, they slowly become better and more differentiated. You level up as well and you can choose which things you want to improve with your points you collect from killing enemies.
